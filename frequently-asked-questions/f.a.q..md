# F.A.Q.

## Why is there no keymapper included in Bliss OS?

We have not found any open source keymappers, so we won't put our users data in jeopardy just for that. 
We are open to working with any developers interested in creating an on-screen keymapper for keyboard/mouse and gamepads though, so please spread the word
For those lost as to why we want to ensure security there, a gaming keymapper will redirect any input from the users device, and can even run when a game is not loaded. So it has the potential to grab passwords, banking info, etc. 
We don't trust anything we can't sift through the source of enough these days, so this is why we haven't included one as of yet
