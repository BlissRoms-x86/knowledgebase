# Desktop Mode

We have a number of requests on how to use the included Desktop Mode. 

**Ways to enable Desktop UI:**

1. enable Taskbar from the Quick Settings tile in the notification drawer. 
2. Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Defaults &gt; Home. And set Taskbar as Home. Then adjust Taskbar Settings through that app in its app drawer. 
3. Launch the Desktop Mode app from any other launchers App Drawer to enable the Desktop UI experience separately from your current launcher
